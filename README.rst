==================
Mini Issue Tracker
==================

Overview
========

This issue tracker is a very very very small (albeit very efficient) issue
tracker build on top of the automatic Django admin.

.. note::

    Please note that I (Bruno Bord) am not the original author of this piece
    of software. I first saw this on Django Snippets: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/28/
    It's the work of Paul Bissex - Many thanks to him.

    This snippet was designed for older versions of Django, and I just thought
    it deserved a fresh new start, using the latest Django features.
